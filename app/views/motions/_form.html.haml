                %p If someone says no on a proposal that you support, pay attention to their concerns, and see if you can help address them by posting in the discussion (or contacting them by other means).
                %p Loomio makes it easy for people to change their mind so groups can come to a shared understanding through discussion. Loomio also makes it easy to start a new proposal in light of new information or to address concerns that have been raised.
