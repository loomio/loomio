    %h2 Loomio retention calculator v0.1
    %p
      This table shows the key group metrics for each month. So for instance, in the March row, you can see
      %ul
        %li
          how many parent groups were
          %strong acquired
          (created sometime in March)
        %li
          how many were
          %strong activated
          (invited multiple people)
        %li
          how many of them were
          %strong retained 30 days
          (had new comments any time after April 1)
        %li
          and how many were
          %strong retained 90 days
          (had new comments any time after June 1)

    %h2 Disclaimers
    %p
      This is the first iteration of a retention calculator, and will need improvement. Specifically:
      %ul
        %li A group created on March 31st and active on April 1st currently meets the definition of 'retained'.
        %li A group with new proposals but no new comments will not meet the definition of 'retained'.
        %li The R30 for March should tell you how many groups created in March were active <em>in</em> April, but it currently tells you how many were active <em>since</em> April.

    %h2 Retention by group size
    %p The following table then splits this data up by group size: small (2-19 members), medium (20-49), large (50+).

        %th Activated
