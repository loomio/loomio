        Muting is a way to hide or silence threads you're not interested in.
        Muting means you won't see it in <strong>Recent</strong> or <strong>Unread</strong>, and you won't be notified about activity in that thread, like proposals.
        You'll only be alerted if someone <strong>@mentions</strong> your name.
      instructions: 'To mute a thread, hover over it and click the mute icon.'
      see_muted_html: 'To see your muted threads, click <strong>"Muted"</strong>. You can unmute by hovering and clicking the same icon.'

      <p>A proposal is a tool for seeking collective agreement about a statement or course of action.</p>
      <p>Participants can agree, abstain, disagree or block - and give a statement to explain their position.</p>
      <p>A pie chart gives an overview of the positions in the group, while the statements allow individual voices to be heard. </p>
      <p>Don't be discouraged if you don't see agreement at first, proposals are designed to surface issues that need resolving.</p>
      <p>With good participation a proposal is a powerful mandate to take action.</p>

      <p>A <em>check</em> is a tool with many possible uses but only 2 responses: a tick (âœ”) or an x mark (âœ˜). Participants will use the tick (âœ”) to say yes and the x mark (âœ˜) to say no or unsure.</p>
      <p>Use it to engage people with an offer, like an RSVP: "I'm coming to the event" or "I'll join the working group".</p>
      <p>Or use it to track completion of a task: "I've checked my contact details are correct", or "I've read the document and left my feedback".</p>
      <p>A check has a <em>goal</em>, which is the number of participants you'd like. The goal indicates to the group if something needs more attention or is well subscribed.</p>
      <p>A day before the check closes, it will remind those who have not participated to do so - like a digital cat herder.</p>
