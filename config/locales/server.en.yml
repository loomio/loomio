      Welcome to Loomio, an online place to make decisions together.

      This is an example discussion **thread**. Why not use this space to try out Loomio’s features?

      You are currently reading the thread **context**. Use this space to give the background information the group needs for a productive discussion.

      The **proposal** panel is where you make decisions. You can start proposals and participate in them there.

      The **activity** panel below shows everything that’s happened in this thread.

      Hi folks, I’m the Loomio Helper Bot.

      If you want to get the attention of a specific person in your group, type @ into the comment field, followed by their name :)

      Here are some things you might want to try to get things under way:

      - Set your [profile picture](/profile)
      - Configure your [email settings](/email_preferences)
      - Introduce yourself to the group in the [Welcome to %{group_name} thread](%{thread_url})

      If you’ve got any questions, the first place to check is the [Loomio help manual](http://help.loomio.org).
  first_proposal:
    name: 'Demonstration proposal: let’s go!'
    description: |
      This the proposal **description**. Here you can explain the proposed course of action and give enough detail so that everyone can make a well informed decision.

      To participate in the proposal, choose one of these options:

      - **Agree**: “I agree with this and want it to go ahead.”
      - **Abstain**: “I am happy for the group to decide without me.”
      - **Disagree**: “I think we can probably do better.”
      - **Block**: “I have strong objections to this proposal and am not OK with it going ahead.”

      When you have chosen, you’ll be prompted for a short statement to explain why you feel the way you do. You can change your position at any time while the proposal is still open.

        # What is markdown?

      body: |
        Markdown is a way of writing plain text (left),
        so that it can be converted to rich text (right).

        This page is written in markdown to show how it works.

    headers:
      body: |
        ## Headings

        Use hashes to turn text into a heading.

        # This is an h1
        ## This is an h2
        #### This is an h4

    paragraphs:

        ## Paragraphs

      body: |
        You need
        to put a
        blank line
        in between lines.

        Or it will end up as one big paragraph!

    emphasis:

        ## Emphasis

      body: |
        You can italicize a word with _underscore_ or *star*.

        __Bold__ a word by doubling the **emphasis**.

        ## Lists

      body: |
        Here's how to make a list:

        * leave a blank line before your list
        * use stars (*)
        * leave a space after the star

        ## Links and Images

        Repeat out loud:

        Square brackets for name then round brackets for URL. There's no spaces between the brackets.
