    -#Hi there! We've just added a "notifications system" to Loomio.
    -#Have a look at the top of this page - that's where you'll be notified when things happen on Loomio that are relevant to you.
    -#%br
    -#%br
    -#It's going to take some experimenting and tweaking to get this system just right,
    -#so if you have any feedback please don't hesitate to send us an email at contact@loomio.org.

    -#This is just the beginning of our effort to improve notifications on Loomio.
    -#Our next task will be making it easy for you to customise how/when Loomio sends you emails.
    -#Thanks for all your help and patience so far!
