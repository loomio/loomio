    coordinating: Coordinating your Loomio group
    coordinating_details: |
      As the coordinator, you’re responsible for setting up your Loomio group and inviting
      everyone in. As well as learning how to use a new piece of software, your group will
      be learning new processes for collaborating more effectively and making good decisions
      together. Here are some tips for supporting your group to succeed:
    different_ways: Different ways to use Loomio
    engaging_html: |
      <h2>Tips for engaging your group</h2>
      <p>People will be excited to jump in and start participating when there’s an engaging
      proposal on the table. A good proposal contains a plan of action for the group, so
      that it’s immediately obvious what it means to agree or disagree. Think about how you
      can identify discussions/decisions the group is currently undertaking in person or by
      email that would be easier if they were on Loomio.</p>
      <p>If your group is just starting out, you could start a light-hearted decision, to give
      everyone a chance to play with the tool and see the decision-making process in action.</p>
      <p>Another simple way to encourage people to engage in a discussion is to use the @mention
      feature to prompt specific people; this will send them an email to tell them they’ve been
      mentioned in a comment.</p>
    example1_html: |
      <h3>You need the group to discuss a broad topic and develop a solution together</h3>
      <p>Strategy: Discuss a topic for a while before creating a proposal.</p>
      <p>Discussions often reach the best outcome if you build shared understanding
      about the problem before jumping to a specific solution. When people get to
      participate in the process, they’re much more likely to be on board with the outcome.</p>
    example2_html: |
      <h3>You already have a proposal in mind, and you want to get sign-off from the group to move forward.</h3>
      <p>Strategy: Start a discussion about a specific decision and make a proposal immediately.</p>
      <p>If you’ve got a clear outcome in mind but you want to make sure there aren’t any critical concerns,
      you can use the proposal to get quick input into a decision.</p>
      <p>You can do things like finalise a document, approve an application, or sign-off on a piece of work.</p>
    get_in_touch: Get in touch
    get_in_touch_description_html: If you have any questions or feedback, <a href='%{link}'>drop us a line</a>.
    getting_started: Getting started
    getting_started_description: On the left, the group discusses a topic, exchanging ideas and information. When there’s a decision for the group to make, it comes up on the right.
    getting_the_most: Getting the most out of Loomio
    have_your_say: Have your say
    have_your_say_details_html: |
      <p>When you’re ready to have your say, click one of the four decision buttons.</p>
      <p>When you’ve made your decision, give a brief explanation. Underneath the pie,
      you can see what everyone else thinks. This makes it quick and easy to catch up
      with the discussion. As new information comes to light, you can change your
      position at any time.</p>
    have_a_discussion: Have a discussion
    have_a_discussion_description: The topic and any relevant background information sit at the top of the page. Use the comment box to add your voice to the discussion.

    how_it_works: How it works
    invitation_html: |
      <h2>Writing a great invitation</h2>
      <p>The first question every new member will have is ‘what is this group for?’</p>
      <p>Think about the simplest way you can describe the group: What do you want to
      achieve together? What types of decisions will you be making? Who will be involved?</p>
      <p>It can be a good idea to talk to your group first before you invite them to join Loomio.</p>
      <p>People will want to know why they’ve been invited, what’s expected of them,
      and why it’s worth their time to learn how to use a new tool.</p>
    join_the_community: Join the community
    join_the_community_description_html: Everyone is welcome to join the Loomio Community, where we talk about how to make the most of the tool, and how it can be improved.<br /><br /><a href='https://www.loomio.org/groups/3'>Click here to go the Loomio Community group</a>.

      <p>Clicking your group name at the top of the screen takes you to your Group Page,
      where you can see a list of all the discussions and decisions for that group. If
      you’re in more than one group, you can see all the activity in all of your groups
      at once on the Home Page.</p>
      <p>You’ll get email notifications when important things happen in your group.
      You can change your email preferences <a href="%{link}"">here</a>.</p>
    make_a_decision: Make a decision
    make_a_decision_description: When the group is ready to make a decision, anyone can make a proposal. Outline a clear course of action and give some background so everyone knows exactly what it means to agree or disagree.
    prompt_people_details: If you want to get the attention of a specific person in your group, type ‘@’ followed by their name. They’ll get an email letting them know you’ve mentioned them in a comment.
    prompt_people_html: Prompt people with <span class='blue'>@mentions</span>
    positions_agree_description: "<span>Agree</span> means you’re happy with the proposal."
    positions_abstain_description: "<span>Abstain</span> means you’re unsure, or you’re happy for the group to decide without you."
    positions_disagree_description: "<span>Disagree</span> means you think there might be a better alternative, but you’re willing to go with the group’s decision."
    positions_block_description: "<span>Block</span> means you’ve got serious objections and you’ll be extremely unhappy if this proposal goes ahead."
    start_discussion: Starting an engaging discussion
    start_discussion_html: |
      <p>When you start a discussion, make sure the title conveys the topic succinctly.
      Use the Context Panel to give all the background information necessary for the
      group to have a productive and informed discussion.</p>
      <p>During the discussion, the Context Panel can be updated as new information
      comes to light. As well as clarifying the topic, you can use this space for
      sharing resources, summarising the discussion as it progresses, or outlining the
      decision-making protocols your group is using.</p>
    start_proposal: Writing a clear proposal
    start_proposal_html: |
      <p> If you make the title clear and succinct, people will immediately know exactly
      what it means to agree or disagree.</p>
      <p>It’s not the end of the world if a proposal doesn’t get clear agreement immediately.
      If the group doesn’t love the first proposal, anyone can start a new proposal to
      address the concerns raised, and keep the process moving forward.</p>
      <p>Through this dynamic process, the collective wisdom of your group can generate better
      ideas than anyone would have come up with on their own.</p>
      <p>The deadline on a proposal can be extended at any time, if it looks like the decision
      needs some more space. Everyone will get an email notification 24 hours before a proposal closes.</p>
