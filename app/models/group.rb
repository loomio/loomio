By engaging on a topic, discussing various perspectives and information, and addressing any concerns that arise, your group can put their heads together to find the best way forward.

To get the ball rolling, Loomio Helper Bot thinks it would be a great idea for your group to take a holiday together. The pie graph on the right shows how your group feels about the proposal. You can have your say by clicking on one of the decision buttons underneath. "

If you're clear about your position, click one of the icons below (hover over the decision buttons for a description of what each one means).

You'll be prompted to make a short statement about the reason for your decision. This makes it easy to see a summary of what everyone thinks and why. You can change your mind and edit your decision freely until the proposal closes."
