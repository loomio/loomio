        A member makes a motion to propose an action or make a decision by saying, “I
        move to…”. Another member must second the motion by saying, “I second the motion.”
        Once someone seconds the motion, the group votes on the motion. It passes by a
        majority vote or a quorum depending on the rules in the bylaws.</p>
