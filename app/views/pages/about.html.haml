          %p Loomio emerged when activists from the Occupy movement teamed up with the social enterprise network <a href="http://enspiral.com">Enspiral</a>, realising that they were using different approaches to work towards the same aim.
          %p Loomio is being built by a core team in Wellington, New Zealand, and a wider network of friends and supporters all over the world. This video is a presentation by one of the team members that explains some of the background of the project.

            “I gave up my engineering business in October 2011 when the global Occupy movement touched down in Civic Square in Wellington. It was the first time I had met people that shared my anger and concern about the inability of institutions to respond rationally to existential threats like ecosystem collapse, resource depletion, extreme inequality, and runaway climate-change. Occupy was my first taste of the transformative power of decentralised collaborative decision-making. The incredible surge of optimism I felt at Occupy has continued unabated throughout Loomio.” ￼￼￼￼
