Feature: Post a comment in a discussion
  To allow users to share their opinions
  A user must be able to post comments in a discussion

  Scenario: User enables markdown and posts a comment
    Given I am logged in
    And I am a member of a group
    And there is a discussion in the group
    And I don't prefer markdown
    When I visit the discussion page
    And I enable markdown
    And I write and submit a comment
    Then a comment should be added to the discussion
    And the comment should format markdown characters
    And the comment should autolink links
    And the comment should include appropriate new lines
    And markdown should now be on by default

  Scenario: User disable markdown and posts a comment
    Given I am logged in
    And I am a member of a group
    And there is a discussion in the group
    And I prefer markdown
    When I visit the discussion page
