      %p
        Loomio is a #{link_to('cooperative social enterprise', about_path, target: "_blank")}, working to make everyday democracy accessible to as many people as possible. To achieve this vision we’re developing an ethical payment model to resource the software development.

      %p It’s really useful for us to know what types of groups want to use Loomio, and what kind of payment model works best for them.

      %p This isn’t a commitment to pay, just useful information to help us design our model. Thanks!
