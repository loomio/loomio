    coordinating: 'Coordinating your Loomio group'
    coordinating_details: |
       As the coordinator, you’re responsible for setting up your Loomio group and inviting
       everyone in. As well as learning how to use a new piece of software, your group will
       be learning new processes for collaborating more effectively and making good decisions
       together. Here are some tips for supporting your group to succeed:
    different_ways: 'Different ways to use Loomio'
    engaging_html: |
      <h2>Tips for engaging your group</h2>
      <p>People will be excited to jump in and start participating when there’s an engaging
      proposal on the table. A good proposal contains a plan of action for the group, so
      that it’s immediately obvious what it means to agree or disagree. Think about how you
      can identify discussions/decisions the group is currently undertaking in person or by
      email that would be easier if they were on Loomio.</p>
      <p>If your group is just starting out, you could start a light-hearted decision, to give
      everyone a chance to play with the tool and see the decision-making process in action.</p>
      <p>Another simple way to encourage people to engage in a discussion is to use the @mention
      feature to prompt specific people; this will send them an email to tell them they’ve been
      mentioned in a comment.</p>
    example1_html: |
      <h3>You need the group to discuss a broad topic and develop a solution together</h3>
      <p>Strategy: Discuss a topic for a while before creating a proposal.</p>
      <p>Discussions often reach the best outcome if you build shared understanding
      about the problem before jumping to a specific solution. When people get to
      participate in the process, they’re much more likely to be on board with the outcome.</p>
    example2_html: |
      <h3>You already have a proposal in mind, and you want to get sign-off from the group to move forward.</h3>
      <p>Strategy: Start a discussion about a specific decision and make a proposal immediately.</p>
      <p>If you’ve got a clear outcome in mind but you want to make sure there aren’t any critical concerns,
      you can use the proposal to get quick input into a decision.</p>
      <p>You can do things like finalise a document, approve an application, or sign-off on a piece of work.</p>

      achieve together? What types of decisions will you be making? Who will be involved?</p>
      <p>It can be a good idea to talk to your group first before you invite them to join Loomio.</p>
      <p>People will want to know why they’ve been invited, what’s expected of them,
      and why it’s worth their time to learn how to use a new tool.</p>

      <p>When you start a discussion, make sure the title conveys the topic succinctly.
      Use the Context Panel to give all the background information necessary for the
      group to have a productive and informed discussion.</p>
      <p>During the discussion, the Context Panel can be updated as new information
      comes to light. As well as clarifying the topic, you can use this space for
      sharing resources, summarising the discussion as it progresses, or outlining the
      decision-making protocols your group is using.</p>
    start_proposal: "Writing a clear proposal"
    start_proposal_html: |
      <p> If you make the title clear and succinct, people will immediately know exactly
      what it means to agree or disagree.</p>
      <p>It’s not the end of the world if a proposal doesn’t get clear agreement immediately.
      If the group doesn’t love the first proposal, anyone can start a new proposal to
      address the concerns raised, and keep the process moving forward.</p>
      <p>Through this dynamic process, the collective wisdom of your group can generate better
      ideas than anyone would have come up with on their own.</p>
      <p>The deadline on a proposal can be extended at any time, if it looks like the decision
      needs some more space. Everyone will get an email notification 24 hours before a proposal closes.</p>
