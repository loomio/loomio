    getting_started:
      title: Getting started
      intro: |
        When you first get into Loomio, you might join in a few ways.
        Here's some information about each entry point:
      starting_new_group:
        title: When you want to start a new Loomio group
        body_html: |
          If you do not have a Loomio account you can start a new group from the Loomio front page by clicking the <strong>“Try out Loomio beta”</strong> button.
          You will be guided through the steps to start your own group.
          As part of the group setup process, you will need to determine how you want your group to function by customising your group settings.
          You can read more about group settings in the <a href="#group-settings">"Group settings"</a> section of this document.
      invited_into_group:
        title: When you are invited into a Loomio group
        body_html: |
          When you receive an invitation to join an existing Loomio group, the email you receive will include a unique invitation link.
          When you follow this link, if do not have an existing Loomio user account you will be prompted to create an account with your email address and a password.
          If you already have a Loomio account you will be taken straight to the group.
      joining_existing_group:
        title_html: 'When you want to join an existing Loomio group (the <a href="http://loomio.org/explore">Explore page</a>)'
        body:
          explore_page_html: |
            The <a href="https://www.loomio.org/explore">Explore page</a> shows you public groups active on Loomio.
            It is accessible throughout the Loomio app via the <strong>“Public groups”</strong> link in the footer.
            From the <a href="https://www.loomio.org/explore">Explore page</a> you can search for a group by name or keyword, or by category, and click on a group to see its public content.
            A group’s privacy settings determine how you can become a member.
          open_to_join_html: |
            Some public groups are <strong>open to join</strong>, in which case you will see a <strong>"Join group"</strong> button on the group page.
            If you have a Loomio account, clicking the <strong>"Join group"</strong> button adds you to the group.
            If you do not have a Loomio account you will be prompted to set one up.
          by_request_html: |
            Other groups are accessible <strong>by request only</strong>, meaning that coordinators are required to approve (or ignore) membership requests.
            When this is the case you will see an <strong>"Ask to join group"</strong> button on the page.
            Upon clicking the <strong>"Ask to join group"</strong> button you will be prompted to provide an introduction, after which your membership request is sent and the group coordinators notified.
          invitation_only_html: |
            Some public groups allow new members <strong>by invitation only</strong>, in which case you will be able to see the group but there will be no button and no way to join from the group page.
      single_sign_on:
        title: Single sign-on
        body_html: |
            <p>Loomio allows sign-up with Facebook, Google or Twitter.
            If you do not have a Loomio account you can sign up using any of these third-party services by clicking the corresponding button on the <a href="http://loomio.org/users/sign_in">Log in page</a>.
            If you are currently logged in to Google, Facebook or Twitter, this existing account will be detected.
            Otherwise you will be prompted to sign in. When Loomio recognises your existing third-party account, you will be required to follow the prompts to create your Loomio account.<p>
            <p>You may also associate an existing Google, Facebook or Twitter account with an existing Loomio account.
            Ensure you are logged out, visit the <a href="https://www.loomio.org/users/sign_in">Log in page</a> and select your preferred platform.
            Loomio will ask you if you want to create a new account with your existing account on your chosen platform, or link it to your existing Loomio account.</p>
    group_settings:
      title: Group Settings
      intro_html: |
        Starting a new Loomio group can be done at any time.
        When you first start your group you will be given the opportunity to determine how you want the group to function by filling out three forms relating to different aspects of your group’s settings; <strong>Profile</strong>, <strong>Privacy</strong> and <strong>Permissions</strong>.
        The settings for each of these are explained in more detail below.
        If you wish to change your group settings you can do so by clicking the <strong>“Options”</strong> button on the top right-hand corner of the group page, and selecting the <strong>“Edit group settings”</strong> option.
        This will only be visible to group coordinators.
      group_profile:
        title: Group profile
        body_html: |
          Your group profile setup requires you to choose a name for your group, and write a group description.
          Describe what the group is set up to do, for example "A public group for gallery coordinators to approve requests for use of the gallery space" or "The space for our board members to consider budget proposals".
          The purpose of your group can change over time but it's helpful if the description gives new members a clear understanding of what that group is for.
          You are also able to choose your group category.
          If you are a public group and you want people to be able to join the conversation, it's helpful to choose a category so others can use this to search on the <a href="http://loomio.org/explore">Explore page</a>.
      group_privacy:
        title: Group privacy
        intro_html: |
          Your privacy settings determine who can see what you’re doing in your group, and who can gain membership to your group.
          When you set up your group you will need to choose between a few options.
        who_can_find_this_group:
          title: Who can find this group?
          body:
            anyone_html: |
              If you select <strong>“Anyone”</strong>, the group will be listed on the publicly searchable <a href="http://loomio.org/explore">Explore page</a>, and other search  engines.
              This makes it easy for people to find your group, without you having to send them a personal invitation.
              This can be useful for getting large numbers of people who don’t already know each other into a group.
            members_only_html: |
              If you select <strong>“Members only”</strong> the group will not be searchable.
              Only group members will be able to access to the group.
              Selecting this option also affects how people join your group, and who can see your group’s discussions.
              Selecting <strong>“Members only”</strong> ensures that membership is by invitation only, and that you will only be able to have private discussions in your group.
        how_do_people_join:
          title: How do people join?
          body:
            open_html: |
              Selecting the <strong>“Open”</strong> option means anyone with a Loomio account can join the group.
              People will see a <strong>"Join group"</strong> button on the right-hand side of the group page.
              If someone with an existing Loomio account clicks this button they will be added to the group.
              If someone without an existing Loomio account clicks this button then they will be prompted to create an account before they are able to join.
              (Note: the <strong>“Open”</strong> option is not applicable if you have selected the <strong>“Members only”</strong> option from the <strong>“Who can find this group?”</strong> section)
            by_request_html: |
              Selecting the <strong>“By request”</strong> option means anyone can ask to join the group.
              People will see an <strong>"Ask to join group"</strong> button on the right-hand side of your group page.
              When this button is clicked, the person will have the opportunity to introduce themselves, and a membership request will be sent to the group coordinators.
            membership_requests_html: |
              Membership requests can be approved or ignored.
              (Note: the <strong>“By request”</strong> option is not applicable if you have selected the <strong>“Members only”</strong> option from the <strong>“Who can find this group?”</strong> section.)
            invitation_only_html: |
              If you select <strong>“Invitation only”</strong>, no-one can join the group without being individually invited.
              Invitations are sent from the <a href="#inviting-members">"Invite people”</a> page.
        who_can_see_discussions:
          title: Who can see discussions?
          body:
            public_only_html: |
              Selecting the <strong>“Public discussions only”</strong> option means the content of all discussions will be publicly viewable.
              Members of the public who are not signed in to Loomio will be able to read your content, though they will not be able to write comments or participate in discussions.
              This can be helpful if you’re running an open conversation and you want to encourage people to participate.
              (Note: the <strong>“Public discussions only”</strong> option is not applicable if you have selected the <strong>“Members only”</strong> option from the <strong>“Who can find this group?”</strong> section.)
            public_and_private_html: |
              Selecting the <strong>“Allow public and private discussions”</strong> option means members of your group can choose whether discussions they start are public or private.
              This allows discretion around some topics which might be more sensitive, which might be helpful if you only want people who have joined the group to be able to read those conversations.
              (Note: the <strong>“Allow public and private discussions”</strong> option is not applicable if you have selected the <strong>“Members only”</strong> option from the <strong>“Who can find this group?”</strong> section.)
            private_only_html: 'If you select <strong>“Private discussions only”</strong>, no one outside of your group will be able to see the content of your discussions.'
      group_permissions:
        title: Group permissions
        body_html: |
          <p>Your group's permissions dictate which functions of Loomio members of your group are permitted to use.
          When you start your group, you will need to consider whether the group members should have decision-making power, whether they should be able to raise issues or only comment on the issues you raise, etc.
          Being able to regulate which actions your group members can perform means that consultation, supervision, reporting and other situations in which you might need to separate your group members into participants and “observers”, can be easier to manage.</p>
          <p>If you want only some people in your group to have the ability to vote, comment, or start discussions, make those people coordinators and deselect the boxes so non-coordinator members do not have these permissions.</p>
        what_can_members_do:
          title: What can members do?
          invite_and_approve_new_members:
            title: Invite and approve new members
            body_html: |
              Do you want people in your group to be able to <a href="#inviting-members">invite people to join</a>, and, depending on your group privacy settings, approve membership requests?
              When this checkbox is selected everyone in your group will be able to invite new people in, and approve any membership requests.
              When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to invite and approve new members.
          create_subgroups:
            title: Create sub-groups
            body_html: |
              Do you want members to be able to start a new <a href="#subgroups">sub-group</a> within your Loomio group?
              When this checkbox is selected then everyone in your group will be able to create sub-groups.
              When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to create sub-groups.
          start_discussions:
            title: Start discussions
            body_html: |
              Do you want anyone in the group to be able to start <a href="#starting-discussions">new discussions</a>?
              If this checkbox is selected everyone in your group will be able to start discussions.
              When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to start discussions.
          edit_discussion_context:
            title: Edit the context of any discussion in the group
            body_html: |
              Do you want people to be able to change the <a href="#providing-context">context panel</a> of discussions?
              This is the outline of the discussion topic and it can be useful to update as new information emerges.
              When this box is selected everyone in your group will be able to edit the context of any discussion.
              When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to edit the discussion contexts.
              (Discussion authors can always edit their own discussion contexts.)
          edit_comments:
            title: Edit their comments at any time
            body_html: |
              Do you want to allow people to change what they have written in their comments?
              When this box is selected everyone in your group will be able to <a href="#editing-comments">edit their comments</a> at any time.
              When it is deselected, a comment can only be edited until someone else participates in the discussion.
              Comments that have been edited display the word <strong>“Edited”</strong> beneath them.
              Clicking "Edited" will display all previous versions of the comment.
          raise_proposals:
            title: Raise proposals
            body_html: |
              Do you want anyone in the group to be able to <a href="#starting-proposals">raise proposals</a> for the group to vote on?
              When this box is selected then anyone in your group will be able to raise a proposal within a discussion.
              When this box is deselected only group coordinators will be able to raise proposals.
          vote_on_proposals:
            title: Vote on proposals
            body_html: |
              Do you want all members of the group to be able to <a href="#stating-positions">state their position on proposals</a>?
              Or would you prefer if some people could only observe?
              When this box is selected then anyone in your group will be able to state their position on proposals.
              When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to state their position on proposals.
        what_next:
          title: What next?
          body_html: |
            Upon submitting the group setup form you will be directed to your group page.
            From your group page you can invite people to join your group.
            You can read more about invitations in the <a href="#inviting-members">"Inviting new members"</a> section of this document.

      manage_membership:
        title: Managing membership
        body_html: |
          Group coordinators are responsible for managing the memberships within their group.
          This means adding and removing members, and granting and removing coordinator permissions.
          Coordinators can also send an email to all members of their group.
          These actions can be performed from the <strong>"Members"</strong> index page.

          To access the <strong>"Members"</strong> page, click this button and select the <strong>“Manage members”</strong> option.

              As a group coordinator you will receive an email each time there is a request to approve.
              Clicking the link in the notification email will take you to the <strong>"Membership requests"</strong> page, where you can approve or decline the request.
            pending_requests_html: |
              If there is a pending membership request it will also be visible on your group page in a <strong>"Membership requests"</strong> panel.

            Clicking this button will give the corresponding member coordinator permissions.
            Next to every coordinator there will be a <strong>“Remove coordinator”</strong> button.

      deactivating_groups:
        title: Deactivating/archiving a group
        body_html: |

          Deactivated groups can be restored by a member of the Loomio team.
          To reactivate your deactivated group, contact the Loomio team by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.org">contact@loomio.org</a>.

          title: 'Create an engaging first proposal:'
          body: |
            People will be excited to jump in and start participating when there’s an engaging proposal on the table.
            A good proposal contains a plan of action for the group, so that it’s immediately obvious what it means to agree or disagree.
            Think about how you can identify discussions/decisions the group is currently undertaking in person or by email that would be easier if they were on Loomio.
            Alternatively, if your group wants to get accustomed to using the tool before using it to address real decisions, you could start a light-hearted decision to give everyone a chance to play with the tool and see the decision-making process in action.

          title_html: 'Encourage <a href="#mentioning">@mentioning</a>:'
          body: Another simple way to encourage people to engage in a discussion is to use the @mention feature to prompt specific people; this will send them an email to tell them they’ve been mentioned in a comment.

      title: Inviting new members
      body:
        intro_html: |
          Depending on your <a href="#group-settings">group settings</a>, new members can be invited either by everyone in the group, or by coordinators only.
          The <strong>Invitations</strong> page is accessed by clicking the <strong>"Invite people"</strong> button on your group page.
        invitation_instructions_html: |
          To invite new people into your group, enter their email addresses, separated by commas.
          You can choose to use Loomio's default message, or create a custom message.
        customising_invitations_html: |
          Customising the invitation message can be a great opportunity to engage new members from the outset.
          The first question every new member will have is <strong><i>"what is this group for?"</i></strong>.
          Think about the simplest way you can describe the group: <strong><i>What do you want to achieve together?
          What types of decisions will you be making? Who will be involved?</i></strong> People will want to know why they’ve been invited, what’s expected of them, and why it’s worth their time to learn how to use a new tool.

            Once your contacts have been imported you don’t need to fill in individual email addresses; you can just start typing names and suggestions will pop up.
            You can import your Google contacts from the <strong>"Invite people"</strong> page.
          instructions_html: |
            Click the <strong>“Import your contacts from Google”</strong> link under the email addresses field.
            You will be prompted to grant Loomio permission to see your contact list.

        title: Providing context
        body_html: |
          <p>Once you've clicked the <strong>"Start a discussion"</strong> button, the subsequent form requires you to provide a <strong>title</strong> and <strong>context</strong> for your discussion.
          Make sure the title conveys the topic succinctly – what is the core message?
          Long discussion titles will be truncated on the dashboard.</p>
          <p>The context field allows you to elaborate on the title and provide any relevant background information.
          Try to provide all the background information someone might need to meaningfully participate – everything required for the group to have a productive and informed discussion.</p>
          <p>The discussion title and the information you provide for the context field will sit in a panel at the top of the discussion page.</p>
          <p>As the discussion progresses, the context panel can be updated as new information comes to light.
          As well as clarifying the topic, you can use this space for sharing resources, summarising the discussion as it progresses, or outlining the decision-making protocols your group is using.</p>
          <p>Loomio uses <strong>Markdown</strong> to let you format text and embed images. You can use Markdown in the context panel to format your discussion context, or to embed images.
          For more information on how to use Markdown, click the <a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/Wh7vHaTk/markdown-text-formatting-made-easy">"Help"</a> link next to the Markdown checkbox on the new discussion form, or visit the Markdown help page directly: <a href="/markdown" target="_blank">loomio.org/markdown</a>.</p>

          The group creator determines whether or not group members can edit each others’ discussions (see <a href="#group-settings">group settings</a>), and any group coordinators have the ability to change the permissions around editing discussions.</p>
          <p>The option to edit a discussion will only be visible to group members with the correct permissions.
          If you have the correct permissions to edit a discussion, then you can do so by clicking the cog icon at the top-right of the discussion page, and then selecting the <strong>“Edit discussion”</strong> option from the dropdown menu.</p>

          If you want to move a discussion, click the cog icon at the top-right of the discussion page and then select <strong>“Move discussion”</strong>.
          You will be asked to choose which of your groups you want to move the discussion to.

        body_html: |
          To allow for fixing typos, you can edit a comment after it is posted.
          By default, groups are configured so that a comment can only be edited until someone else contributes a comment to the discussion.

    proposals:
      title: Proposals
      intro_html: |
        Proposals take place in a <a href="#discussion-threads">discussion thread</a>, which encompasses both the discussion and the proposal.
        There can only be one active proposal in a single discussion thread.
        Loomio encourages groups to use an initial discussion to consider multiple options.
        A proposal is one proposed course of action that naturally emerges when it looks like a one idea is gaining traction.
      starting_proposals:
        title: Starting a proposal
        body:
          instructions_html: 'When the group is ready to make a decision, you can raise a proposal by clicking the <strong>"Create a proposal"</strong> button on the right-hand side of the discussion page.'
          additional_info_html: |
            <p>When you create a new proposal you will be required to provide a <strong>title</strong>, a <strong>closing date</strong> and any relevant <strong>details</strong>.
            It’s a good idea to use a short title indicating a clear course of action so that people immediately know exactly what it means to agree or disagree.
            The <strong>“Details”</strong> field can be used to provide any background information so everyone has the context required to make an informed decision. </p>
            <p>Keep in mind that it’s not the end of the world if a proposal doesn’t get clear agreement immediately. If the group doesn’t love the first proposal, a new proposal can be started to address the concerns raised, and keep the process moving forward.
            The deadline on a proposal can also be extended if it looks like the decision needs some more space.</p>
            <p>Everyone will get an email notification 24 hours before a proposal closes.</p>
      editing_proposals:
        title: Editing a proposal
        body:
          intro_html: |
            Group coordinators and the proposal author can edit the proposal details until a group member states their position.
            However, the closing time for the proposal can be changed by a group coordinator or the proposal author at any time over the course of the proposal.
            A proposal can also be closed before its scheduled closing time if it becomes clear that it is not meeting the needs of the group.
          instructions_html: The <strong>"Edit proposal"</strong> page is accessed via the <strong>"Edit"</strong> link inside the <strong>"Current decision"</strong> panel on the right-hand side of the page.

          additional_info_html: |
            <p>When you’ve selected your position, you will be prompted to give a brief explanation as to why you feel this way.</p>
            <p>Underneath the pie graph, you can see what everyone else thinks.
            This makes it easy to catch up with the discussion.
            As new information comes to light, you can change your position at any time over the course of the proposal.</p>
      changing_positions:
        title: Changing your position
        body_html: If you wish to change your position you can do so by clicking <strong>“edit”</strong> next to your position statement in the <strong>“Current decision”</strong> panel on the right-hand side of the page.

          When a proposal ends, it will remain on the right-hand side of the discussion page, inside a <strong>“Previous decisions”</strong> panel.
          An editable outcome statement field will appear underneath the proposal title, and the person who raised the proposal will be prompted via email to provide an outcome statement for their proposal.
          Proposal outcomes can only be set by the person who started the proposal or the coordinators of the group.
          Setting a proposal outcome is a good opportunity to get all group members up to speed, so everyone understands what the implications of the proposal are, and they are aware of any next steps.
          When the proposal outcome statement is submitted everyone in the group will receive an email notifying them of the outcome.
      closing_proposals:
        title: Closing a proposal
        body_html: |
          Only the group member who started the proposal and the coordinators of the group can close an active proposal.

          At the bottom of the <strong>“Edit proposal”</strong> form on the subsequent page there will be an option to close the proposal early.
          When a proposal is closed early it will remain on the right-hand side of the discussion page in a <strong>“Previous decisions”</strong> panel, but participants will no longer be able to submit their positions.
      previous_decisions:
        title: Closed proposals/previous decisions

    subgroups:
      title: Sub-groups
      body:
        intro_html: |
          Often you will have a need for multiple Loomio groups that are all related to one organisation, but you may find that each group has different needs for membership, privacy and permissions.
          This is where sub-groups are useful.
        creation_instructions_html: 'If you wish to create a sub-group within a group and you have the <a href="#group-permissions">correct permissions</a>, you can do so by clicking the <strong>“Create a sub-group”</strong> link in the <strong>“Sub-groups”</strong> panel on the right-hand side of your group page.'

            <p>Sub-group settings are the same as <a href="#group-settings">group settings</a>, but with slightly different privacy options relating to sub-group visibility relative to the parent group.</p>
            <p>The options underneath <strong>“Who can find this group?”</strong> (in the <strong>“Privacy”</strong> section of the new sub-group form) determine whether people in the parent group can see the sub-group.
            When the <strong>“People in [parent group]”</strong> option is selected then the group will be visible in the <strong>"Sub-groups"</strong> panel on the parent group page, or when members of the parent navigate to the sub-group page, even if they are not members of the sub-group.</p>
            <p>There is also a privacy option relating to the sub-group's discussion privacy.
            If you decide that your group should be visible to members of the parent but not public, then in the <strong>“Who can see discussions?”</strong> segment of the <strong>“Privacy”</strong> settings, you can choose whether you want discussions to be visible to members of the parent, or to members of the sub-group only.
            If you choose to make discussions visible to sub-group members only, then members of the parent will be able to view the sub-group's page, but not see any of the sub-group's discussions threads.</p>
            <p>When the <strong>“People in [parent group]”</strong> option is deselected, only members of the sub-group will be able to find it.</p>
          editing_settings_html: |

      body: |
        Your dashboard is your home page. It gives you an overview of what is happening in your groups.
        It is the page you see when you first log in to Loomio. Your dashboard displays content from your groups in a prioritised list.
        Open proposals are at the top, followed by all of the discussion threads from all of the groups you are a member of, sorted by most recent activity.
        If a discussion or proposal title is grey then new activity has taken place since you last viewed that particular thread.
        Numbers above a comment icon reflect how many new comments have been posted since you last viewed the corresponding page.
        A pie graph is a reflection of the state of the pie graph in the corresponding proposal.
        When numbers appear above the pie graph this reflects the number of new position statements that have been posted since you last viewed the corresponding page.
        If you have stated your position on a particular proposal, you will see an icon that represents your position in front of the corresponding proposal title.

      body_html: |
        <p>Loomio is a password-protected service, and each Loomio account is tied to a verified email address.

Private groups are viewable only to members of the group.</p>
        <p>Loomio is hosted by Heroku in the US, with cloud services provided by AWS/EC2 and encryption and authenticity provided by SSL.</p>
        <p>We use secure HTTP protocol (HTTPS), providing bidirectional encryption. Our privacy, security and backup systems meet industry best practice.</p>
        <p>For more information about privacy, service hosting and data security please take a look at our privacy page: <a href="/privacy">loomio.org/privacy</a>.</p>
        <p>If you have any specific security concerns we recommend installing your own instance of Loomio.</p>

      email_signature_included_in_reply_title: 'When I reply to a discussion via email my signature is included in my comment, how can I stop it?'
      email_signature_included_in_reply_body_html: |
        <p>There is currently no official standard for identifying email signatures from the rest of the email body. To a computer the whole email is just a block of text.
        The easiest method we have for marking the end of the email body and the beginning of the signature is the double-dash method popularised by Gmail, which involves inserting a double-dash ('--') on it's own line between the body of an email and the signature.
        Other common formats are recognised too, but Gmail's method is very easy to implement. Most programs trying to separate email body from signature (including Loomio) will correctly import the body if these dashes are included in the right place.</p>
        <p>To be sure that your email signature is not included in your comment when you reply by email, you need to begin your signature with a double hyphen on its own line. For example:</p>
