    %h1 Get started with Loomio
    %p Exciting news! Loomio is now in private beta! 
    %p This means we’re still in development and have limited resources for user support, but we love bringing on nice groups that are keen to get on board early.
    %p There’s some basic info at <a href ='http://loomio.org'>loomio.org</a> to make it easy to explain to your group why you’d like to use Loomio to make decisions together online. 
    %p If your group is keen, you can request access here: 
    
    =render '/application/button', :button_text => 'I’ve talked to my group, and we’d like to use Loomio!', :button_icon => 'none', :args => {:href => "#request-new",  "data-toggle" => "modal", :class => 'btn btn-large btn-primary', :id => 'request-new-group'}
