  first_proposal:
    name: Demonstration proposal
    description: |
      This is a **proposal**, where you can make a decision together. You can start a proposal once a discussion is underway.

      Everyone is asked to **state a position** by the **deadline**. You can extend the deadline if you need to, or close a proposal early.

      You can **change your position** while the proposal is open. You might reconsider your view as you listen to others.

      Sometimes groups work through a **series of proposals** to build solutions together. You can raise sequential proposals in this thread.

      **Try participating! Click one of the four buttons**.

        # What is markdown?

      body: |
        Markdown is a way of writing plain text (left),
        so that it can be converted to rich text (right).

        This page is written in markdown to show how it works.

    headers:
      body: |
        ## Headings

        Prefix with a hash and a space to turn text into a heading.

        # This is an h1
        ## This is an h2
        #### This is an h4

    paragraphs:
      title: |
        ## Paragraphs

      body: |
        You need
        to put a
        blank line
        in between lines.

        Or it will end up as one big paragraph!

    emphasis:
      title: |
        ## Emphasis

      body: |
        You can italicize a word with _underscore_ or *star*.

        __Bold__ a word by doubling the **emphasis**.

    lists:
      title: |
        ## Lists

      body: |
        Here's how to make a list:

        * leave a blank line before your list
        * use stars (*)
        * leave a space after the star

    links:
      title: |
        ## Links and Images

      body: |
        Repeat out loud:

        Square brackets for name then round brackets for URL. There's no spaces between the brackets.

        [Loomio Homepage](https://www.loomio.org/)

        Images are the same, but prefixed with an exclamation mark.
