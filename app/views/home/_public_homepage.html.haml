        %p Loomio is a free open-source web application that helps groups make better decisions together.

          -#%strong Why?
        -#%p
          -#Right now, the world is suffering because groups of humans are making bad decisions.
          -#Decision making processes are failing globally and locally.
          -#The right tool will help groups, big and small, achieve better outcomes.
        -#%p
          -#Most groups use one of two basic models to make decisions: top-down or bottom-up.
          -#Top-down decision making gets things done quickly. There's a chain of command, so once a decision is made it can be implemented right away.
          -#But this can lead to people feeling alienated from the decision-making process, and leave good ideas ignored.
        -#%p
          -#In bottom-up decision making, everyone has a say. People feel invested in the process, good ideas dont get ignored,
          -#marginalised voices are heard, and everyone affected by a decision has input. But bottom-up decision making can be difficult to facilitate.
          -#If a group decides everything through face to face discussions, only one person can speak at a time,
          -#and people who attend the most meetings or have the loudest voice might end up having more sway.
          -#It can be frustratingly time-consuming and inefficient.
        -#%hr/
        -#%p
          -#%strong The best of both worlds.
        -#%p
          -#By using technology we can enable groups to make decisions in fundamentally new ways.
          -#We can avoid the false tradeoff between speed and participation and say yes to both.
        -#%p
          -#In the age of the internet, we don't all have to be in the same place at the same time to work together.
          -#Loomio turns a messy online discussion into a clear, visual picture of how the group feels
          -#Everyone can talk at once and all voices are heard, while the group stays focused and concise.
          -#Loomio will adapt to any group that needs to make decisions together. From households, to neighbourhoods, from businesses to community groups, and even government.
          -#Loomio helps groups move together.
