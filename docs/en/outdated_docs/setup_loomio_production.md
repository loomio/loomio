## Setting up Loomio on Ubuntu Linux based VPS's.

This guide assumes that you have a little bit of experience using ssh, git and linux and can provision your own VPS or server. I've also assumed that you have a domain name for your Loomio install figured out. Something like `loomio.myexistingdomainname.com` will be fine. Good luck, and I hope that you find everything straight forward. If you have problems the appropriate place to ask for help is the [installing Loomio group](https://www.loomio.org/g/C7I2YAPN/loomio-community-installing-loomio) in the Loomio Community. You can expect that setting up Loomio will take 2 to 4 hours to complete.
