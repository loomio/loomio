      quote: |
        We were communicating between meetings through email, but very often we weren’t actually coming to a decision. On Loomio, we’re able to have a discussion and make a decision. And if you’ve got a lot of things to discuss in a meeting, you can say, ‘We can decide this on Loomio instead’. It’s made face-to-face meetings more efficient.

        You need to be able to create trust. People want to understand what’s going on. There’s a need for documentation: being able to show this decision was made, it was agreed by everyone. And it’s great for new people that join to be able to see what has been discussed already. It’s really critical to become more of a learning organisation.

      quote: |
        When you knock off at the end of the day the conversation continues through the different time zones, meaning you get closer to a decision even as you sleep. That speeds everything up and increases the accuracy of getting the decision right the first time. In the startup world, that combination is gold.

    story:
      heading: Story
      first_paragraph: |
        Loomio began in 2011, when activists from Occupy Wall Street and social entrepreneurs from the Enspiral Network realised they needed to solve the same problem: fast, inclusive, effective decision-making without meetings.
        In 2012, we formed our cooperative and released a prototype (Loomio Beta). We found that many others around the world needed the same solution.
      second_paragraph: |
        In 2013, we ran a successful international crowdfunding campaign, enabling us to work on a new version of the software, Loomio 1.0, which was released the following year.
        In 2015, we raised a round of ethical capital, and are working to bring collaborative decision-making to millions more people around the world.
