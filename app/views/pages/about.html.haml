          %p Loomio emerged when activists from the Occupy movement teamed up with the social enterprise network <a href="http://enspiral.com">Enspiral</a>, realising that they were using different approaches to work towards the same aim.
          %p Loomio is being built by a core team in Wellington, New Zealand, and a wider network of friends and supporters all over the world. This video is a presentation by one of the team members that explains some of the background of the project.

We are making it possible for people to have a voice, to participate in generating collective wisdom, and to take tested ideas into action. We are co-creating new ways of approaching authority, accountability and choice in the workplace, but I am perhaps most inspired by the feeling we are creating tools for a more generative and generous future where everyone can be involved in making the decisions that affect them."

            “I was initially attracted to the Loomio project by a need to combine my passion to work on social good projects and the opportunity to upskill in a dynamic like-minded team committed to agile processes. Aside from the coding, I have owned and operated a cafe with my partner and travelled ￼￼￼￼￼extensively throughout the world. The experiences I encountered and the inequalities I felt encouraged and validated the need for my current undertakings with Loomio. With a very complimentary skill set and the infusion of collaborative ability attained by developing Loomio, I feel I have found the people and the project to pour my soul into.”

            “I gave up my engineering business in October 2011 when the global Occupy movement touched down in Civic Square in Wellington. It was the first time I had met people that shared my anger and concern about the inability of institutions to respond rationally to existential threats like ecosystem collapse, resource depletion, extreme inequality, and runaway climate-change. Occupy was my first taste of the transformative power of decentralised collaborative decision-making. The incredible surge of optimism I felt at Occupy has continued unabated throughout Loomio.” ￼￼￼￼
