# How do I give feedback about Loomio?

We really appreciate it when people take the time to give us feedback.

If you have anything at all that you want to share about your experience with Loomio then fill in our [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/a/enspiral.com/forms/d/1JS75ZdoBiA3k7IzxDPijV4kPh1fXrmWs9A8k_WG_pyE/viewform) and the product team will review it within a few days.

## Found a bug?

The first thing we do with a bug report is confirm we see the bug too. If we can make the bug happen on our computers, then we know when we've fixed it. So please try to give us enough information to produce the buggy experience ourselves.

As a general rule, try to include:
* What you did
* What you were expecting to happen
* What actually happened.
* What web browser you were using.

If you fill in your name on the feedback form we'll be able to let you know when the bug is fixed, and contact you if we need more information.

If you’re reporting a bug in the software and want to work with the team directly we invite you to bypass the feedback form and [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/loomio/loomio/issues/new). You'll need a github account, so if that sounds like too much effort, just enter your bug into the feedback form above.

### Example bug reports:

“I was filling in the comment form, I clicked the post button, and the field went gray. I was expecting to then be told my comment was added, but it remained gray. I ended up refreshing the page. I’m on Firefox on Mac.”

“When I login with the “Sign in with Google” button, I am logged out after 24 hours and I have to login again. I’m using my Iphone ”.

## Feature requests

Often feedback is not a bug report - it’s more like "I would really like it if Loomio did something differently". We love to hear what you want to do with Loomio. Please fill in the [Feedback form](https://docs.google.com/a/enspiral.com/forms/d/1JS75ZdoBiA3k7IzxDPijV4kPh1fXrmWs9A8k_WG_pyE/viewform) and we'll be sure to consider your suggestion.
