# Loomio QA checklist template
Copy this into the context panel of a QA thread.
Deploy your feature branch to a public test environment, provide a link to the environment and give instructions about how to test the feature.

When testers have checked aspects of the branch, they should add a âˆš symbol to the box of the corresponding line.
