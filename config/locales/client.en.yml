        Muting is a way to hide or silence threads you're not interested in.
        Muting means you won't see it in <strong>Recent</strong> or <strong>Unread</strong>, and you won't be notified about activity in that thread, like proposals.
        You'll only be alerted if someone <strong>{'@'}mentions</strong> your name.
      instructions: To mute a thread, hover over it and click the mute icon.
      see_muted_html: To see your muted threads, click <strong>"Muted"</strong>. You can unmute by hovering and clicking the same icon.
