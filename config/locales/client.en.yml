        Muting means you won't see it in <strong>Recent</strong> or <strong>Unread</strong>, and you won't be notified about activity in that thread, like proposals.
        You'll only be alerted if someone <strong>@mentions</strong> your name.
      instructions: 'To mute a thread, hover over it and click the mute icon.'

      <p>A proposal is a tool for seeking collective agreement about a statement or course of action.</p>
      <p>Participants can agree, abstain, disagree or block - and give a statement to explain their position.</p>
      <p>A pie chart gives an overview of the positions in the group, while the statements allow individual voices to be heard. </p>
      <p>Don't be discouraged if you don't see agreement at first, proposals are designed to surface issues that need resolving.</p>

      <p>Or use it to track completion of a task: "I've checked my contact details are correct", or "I've read the document and left my feedback".</p>
      <p>A check has a <em>goal</em>, which is the number of participants you'd like. The goal indicates to the group if something needs more attention or is well subscribed.</p>
