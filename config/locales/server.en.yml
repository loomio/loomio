        # What is markdown?

      body: |
        Markdown is a way of writing plain text (left),
        so that it can be converted to rich text (right).

        This page is written in markdown to show how it works.

    headers:
      body: |
        ## Headings

        Prefix with a hash and a space to turn text into a heading.

        # This is an h1
        ## This is an h2
        #### This is an h4

    paragraphs:
      title: |
        ## Paragraphs

      body: |
        You need
        to put a
        blank line
        in between lines.

        Or it will end up as one big paragraph!

    emphasis:
      title: |
        ## Emphasis

      body: |
        You can italicize a word with _underscore_ or *star*.

        __Bold__ a word by doubling the **emphasis**.

    lists:
      title: |
        ## Lists

      body: |
        Here's how to make a list:

        * leave a blank line before your list
        * use stars (*)
        * leave a space after the star

    links:
      title: |
        ## Links and Images

      body: |
        Square brackets with title, round brackets with URL. No spaces between the brackets.

        [Loomio Homepage](https://www.loomio.org/)

        Images are the same, but prefixed with an exclamation mark. Title is used as alt text.

      Just enter a decision type and a question, and we'll take it from there.
      You can choose from the following decision types:
      'proposal': Seek collective agreement
      'count':      Track participation and find volunteers
      'poll':         Measure popularity of options
      'dot_vote': Prioritise a list of options
      'meeting': Find a time to meet
      Or, start a conversation with '/loomio thread <title>'.

      For example:
      /loomio count Who's coming to the party on Sunday?
      In order to start a new count.
      or
      /loomio thread Let's talk about the company direction
      To start a new thread
