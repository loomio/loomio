    Hi there! We've just added a "notifications system" to Loomio.
    Have a look at the top of this page - that's where you'll be notified when things happen on Loomio that are relevant to you.
    %br
    %br
    It's going to take some experimenting and tweaking to get this system just right,
    so if you have any feedback please don't hesitate to send us an email at contact@loom.io.
    %br
    %br
    This is just the beginning of our effort to improve notifications on Loomio.
    Our next task will be making it easy for you to customise how/when Loomio sends you emails.
    Thanks for all your help and patience so far!
