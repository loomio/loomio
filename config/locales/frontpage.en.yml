    our_story_1_html: "<h2>Our story</h2> <p>Loomio is an online tool for collaborative decision-making, built by a team of technologists, activists and social entrepreneurs in New Zealand.</p> "
    our_story_2_html: "<p>Loomio emerged from the need for a scalable way to make inclusive group decisions during the Occupy movement in 2011.</p> <p>We experienced the transformative potential of collaborative decision-making, as well as its severe limitations: if people have to be in the same place at the same time to participate, it can never scale.</p> <p>We set out to build a solution to this problem: using the Internet to give people an easy way to make good decisions together, wherever they are.</p> <p>It’s called Loomio, like a loom for weaving diverse perspectives together :)</p> <p>Now more than 75,000 people have made more than 25,000 decisions on Loomio.</p> "
    mission_html: "<h2>Mission</h2> <p>We’re a mission-driven organisation with a social purpose at our core: Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives.</p> <p>We measure our impact in the numbers of people and groups involved in decisions AND the inspiring stories from people using it to do great things in their communities.</p> "
