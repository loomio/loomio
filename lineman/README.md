# Loomio AngularJS Frontend
This is the beginnings of a document to introduce people to the
AngularJS parts of Loomio. It is assumed that you have the rails parts
of loomio running already.

# Installing Node
Install the latest version of node.js for your system. Go find out how.

# Installing Bower & Lineman

  `$ npm install -g bower`
  `$ npm install -g lineman`

# Installing Dependencies
in the loomio folder

  `$ cd lineman`
  `$ npm install`
  `$ bower install`

# Running
Run the rails development server and Private Pub
  (loomio) `$ rails s`
           `$ rackup private_pub.ru -s thin -E production`

Then start lineman
  (loomio/lineman folder) `$ lineman run`


# Browsing
First go to the rails app (localhost:3000) and sign in. Now you can use the javascript app at localhost:8000. Just navigate to a discussion (e.g. localhost:8000/discussions/325).

# Unit Testing
We're going for high test coverage of our JS frontend here.
You can run the unit tests with

  `$ lineman spec`

# Integration testing
We're not using linemans default e2e testing stuff. Insted we're going for cucumber.js integration tests.


## Installing Protractor & Webdriver-manager
To run the integration tests, you'll need Protractor and Webdriver-manager

  `$ npm install -g protractor`
  `$ webdriver-manager update --standalone`

## Running e2e tests

To run the e2e tests, you need a bit of environment running. It's
probably easiest if you run these each in their own terminal window.

  From the loomio folder:
  `$ rails s`

  From the loomio/lineman folder:
  `$ lineman run`
  `$ webdriver-manager start`

  Then finally to run the tests:
  `$ lineman grunt spec-e2e`
