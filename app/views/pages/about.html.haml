        %h2 Where did Loomio come from?
        %p
          Something interesting happened in 2011. Millions of people all over the world took part in a wave of pro-democracy movements, demanding a change in the way our biggest institutions operate.
        %p
          Loomio is what happened when a bunch of activists from the Occupy movement and businesspeople from a social enterprise network called Enspiral realised that they were using different approaches to work towards the same aim: a more sustainable and equitable world.

          The Loomio project is about individual voices contributing to collective action: enabling all people to have a say in decisions that affect them in all aspects of life – in their community, their workplace, and the world. 
        %p
          Loomio is being built by a team of passionate volunteers in Wellington, New Zealand, and a wider network of friends and supporters all over the world. We’re operating on a non-profit basis, but recognise that Loomio needs to be self-sufficient long term to have as much positive social impact as possible. We’re currently figuring out the fairest way of charging groups who have a budget to pay for helpful tools, so we can help groups who are doing great stuff in the community with no budget.

          “Loomio gives an opportunity for our people to express their own thoughts, ideas, and needs. That room for discussion has helped the community get on the same page about what’s important.”
