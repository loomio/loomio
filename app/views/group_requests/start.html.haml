        %p Exciting news! Loomio is now in private beta!
        %p This means we’re still in development and have limited resources for user support, but we love bringing on nice groups that are keen to get on board early.
        %p There’s some basic info at <a href ='http://loomio.org'>loomio.org</a> to make it easy to explain to your group why you’d like to use Loomio to make decisions together online.
        %p If your group is keen, you can request access here:

        %p
          %a{ :href => new_group_request_path, :class => 'btn btn-large btn-info btn-block' , :id => 'request-new-group' }
            I’ve talked to my group, and we’d like to use Loomio!
