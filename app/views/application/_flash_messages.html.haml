    Hi there! We've just added a "notifications system" to Loomio (have a look at the top of this page).
    That's where you'll be notified when things happen on Loomio that are relevant to you.
    %br
    %br
    It's going to take some experimenting and tweaking to get this sytem just right, so if you
    have any feedback please don't hesitate to send us an email at contact@loom.io.
    %br
    %br
    This is just the beginning of our effort to improve notifications on Loomio. Our next task will be
    making it easy for you to customise how/when Loomio sends you emails. Thanks for all your help and
    patience so far!
