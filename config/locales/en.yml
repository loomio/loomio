  example_discussion:
    title: "Example Discussion: Welcome and introduction to Loomio"
    description: |
      Welcome to Loomio, a new tool for group decision-making.
      By engaging on a topic, discussing various perspectives and information, and addressing any concerns that arise, your group can put their heads together to find the best way forward.
      You can use this example discussion to play around with the features of the tool.
      To get the ball rolling, Loomio Helper Bot thinks it would be a great idea for your group to take a holiday together. The pie graph on the right shows how your group feels about the proposal. You can have your say by clicking on one of the decision buttons underneath.

  example_motion:
    name: "We should have a holiday on the moon!"
    description: |
      Loomio Helper Bot is really keen for your group to invest in a trip to the moon. Apparently the space-cheese is delicious. But the implications for your carbon footprint are worrying.
      Is it a good idea? Loomio Helper Bot wants to know what you think!
      If you’re clear about your position, click one of the icons below (hover over the decision buttons for a description of what each one means).
      You’ll be prompted to make a short statement about the reason for your decision. This makes it easy to see a summary of what everyone thinks and why. You can change your mind and edit your decision freely until the proposal closes.
