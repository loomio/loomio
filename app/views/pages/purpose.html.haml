          %p With the right collaborative process, groups generate better ideas, decisions and actions than any individual would by themselves.
          %p Loomio breaks down the barriers to participation in decision-making at every level: in neighbourhoods, community organisations, businesses, social movements, and local and national governance.
          %p.no-bottom-margin Collaborative decision-making balances individual autonomy with the collective good.

          %h2 Cooperative social enterprise
          %h3 Loomio is a social enterprise collectively owned by the people building it.
          %p Social enterprise creates social and environmental benefit in a way that generates sustainable revenue. Unlike a traditional profit-maximising company, revenue is not an end in itself, but a means towards achieving a core social purpose.
          %p A worker-owned cooperative structure is a powerful way to live our values of collaboration and collective ownership. This legal structure embodies our commitment to democracy in the workplace and connects us to a global movement based on cooperation.

          %p We’re immensely proud of our diverse and growing user community: community organisations, businesses, educators, government departments, social activist groups, and families.
          %p Loomio needs to remain independent to support this diversity. We will never do anything to compromise our autonomy or core purpose. We will never sell your data.

          %h3 Loomio is free software, meaning that anyone has the freedom to run, read, learn from, modify and redistribute the code.
          %p Loomio couldn’t be anything other than open-source.
          %p Peer-production is transforming the way communities create value, laying the foundation for a new economy of abundance. Open collaboration unlocks collective wisdom on a scale we’ve never seen before, producing invaluable public resources like Wikipedia and Linux.
          %p Free software is about the freedom of the user, not the price of the service. Groups with a budget contribute financially for the use of Loomio. This means we can gift it to groups without a budget.

Communicating this information effectively is an ongoing challenge that we look forward to undertaking with our community.

          %p As the conversation progresses and new information comes to light, you can change your position as many times as you like until the proposal closes. If the group isn’t in love with the first proposal, anyone can suggest a better one and keep moving forward. Through this dynamic process, the collective wisdom of your group can generate better ideas than anyone would have come up with on their own.
