          %p With the right collaborative process, groups generate better ideas, decisions and actions than any individual would by themselves.
          %p Loomio breaks down the barriers to participation in decision-making at every level: in neighbourhoods, community organisations, businesses, social movements, and local and national governance.
          %p.no-bottom-margin Collaborative decision-making balances individual autonomy with the collective good.

          %h3 Loomio is a social enterprise collectively owned by the people building it.
          %p Social enterprise creates social and environmental benefit in a way that generates sustainable revenue. Unlike a traditional profit-maximising company, revenue is not an end in itself, but a means towards achieving a core social purpose.
          %p A worker-owned cooperative structure is a powerful way to live our values of collaboration and collective ownership. This legal structure embodies our commitment to democracy in the workplace and connects us to a global movement based on cooperation.

          %p We’re immensely proud of our diverse and growing user community: community organisations, businesses, educators, government departments, social activist groups, and families.
          %p Loomio needs to remain independent to support this diversity. We will never do anything to compromise our autonomy or core purpose. We will never sell your data.

          %p Loomio couldn’t be anything other than open-source.
          %p Peer-production is transforming the way communities create value, laying the foundation for a new economy of abundance. Open collaboration unlocks collective wisdom on a scale we’ve never seen before, producing invaluable public resources like Wikipedia and Linux.
          %p Free software is about the freedom of the user, not the price of the service. Groups with a budget contribute financially for the use of Loomio. This means we can gift it to groups without a budget.

Communicating this information effectively is an ongoing challenge that we look forward to undertaking with our community.
