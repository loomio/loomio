            Privacy Policy
        .span8.offset2
          %p This privacy policy outlines our practices for the types of information Loomio gathers, how we use it, with whom we share it, and the notices and choices affected individuals can expect regarding the information. Our overriding principle is that we will not sell or rent any information you share with us.

            Non-personally-identifiable information
        .span8.offset2
          %p Like most website operators, Loomio collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Loomio’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Loomio’s visitors use the website. From time to time, Loomio may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

          %p Loomio also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Loomio does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

            Third Parties
        .span8.offset2
          %p
            To provide some of Loomio’s functionality and a high level of service, Loomio shares user data with third parties. These third parties adhere to industry best practices meaning that they in turn will not sell any data shared with them. Please see
            =link_to "this list of the services", third_parties_path
            Loomio uses.
          %p It is possible that these services may be compelled by court order to share the information they have with law enforcement.
          %p If you are concerned about third party services, we’re making it as easy as possible for you to install your own instance of Loomio, so you have complete control of how your data is treated. This way, self-hosted users will be able to easily disable these services and use their own internal networks for all data.

        .span8.offset2
          %p We will always maintain the overriding principle that we will not sell or rent any  information you share with us. However, we may change other aspects of this policy. Any amended policy is effective upon posting to this website, and we’ll make every effort to tell you about these changes via email or through the site.
          %p Thanks for taking the time to learn about our privacy policy. We feel it's increasingly important for people to know exactly how their information is treated online, so we've tried to make the policy as clear and specific as possible.
